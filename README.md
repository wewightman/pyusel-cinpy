# pyusel-cinpy
Interface tools for C-type pointers handled in python. 
This package is used to create a simple interface for translating numpy and c-type arrays to one another

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/wewightman/pyusel-cinpy/
cd pyusel-cinpy
pip install .
```
## Usage
Currently, this package is limited to 1D arrays and 2D matricies. 
Currently only compatible with float32 datatype.

### Fundamental types in python
Python inputs and outputs to python are numpy arrays (1D or 2D). Return arrays are numpy arrays in float32

### Fundamental types in C
To allow passing of valid memory indices, all ctype arrays are a pointing to a 1D or 2D pointer.
aka, a 2D matrix is represented in python as a pointer to a pointer-of-pointers-of-floats, an array is  a pointer to a pointer of floats.

Within a python environment, it is recommended to store c-variables as a pointer or pointer of pointers, then pass by reference

### Example
Let's say that we wrote a C function, `mult2D_f` with the declaration...

`float *** dot2D_f(float*** a, float *** b, int M, int N)`

...and made a ctypes wrapper for it which is used as follows...

`c = py_dot2D_f(a, Ma, Na, b, Mb, Nb)`. 
 
With Ctypes wrappers, the base input has to be a ctype. As such, the python interface wrapper (a python function with pythonic inputs and outputs) would have to call the c function wrapper as follows...

```
import ctypes as ct
import numpy as np
import cinpy

# load compiled file
custom_c = ct.CDLL("<name of compiled file>")

# define python inputs
custom_c.dot2D_f.argtypes = ct.POINTER(ct.POINTER(ct.POINTER(ct.c_float))), ct.POINTER(ct.POINTER(ct.POINTER(ct.c_float))), ct.c_int, ct.c_int, 
custom_c.dot2D_f.restype = ct.POINTER(ct.POINTER(ct.POINTER(ct.c_float)))

def py_int_dot2D(a, b):
    # returns copyed arrays in dynamic memory space as float** with sizes in cints
    A, Ma, Na = cinpy.copy2c(a)
    B, Mb, Nb = cinpy.copy2c(b)
    
    if (Ma != Mb) or (Na != Nb):
        cinpy.free(A, Ma)
        cinpy.free(B, Mb)
        raise ValueError("Matrices must be the same size")
    
    pointer = custom_c.dot2D_f(ct.byref(A), ct.byref(B), Ma, Na)
    c = cinpy.copy2py(pointer, Ma, Na)
    return c
```
